                <p> Java will be the language that is discussed in this section </p>
                <p> The main goal of Java was to allow programmers to write a code that could be compiled anywhere. The ability to have code that is easily compiled means it is greatly accessible.</p>
                <p> Java has become one of the most popular languages because of its accesiblity as well as its albility to run on many different systems. </p>
                <p> Java was released in 1995 by James Gosling and has since been aquired by the Oracle Corporation. </p>
                <p> The language was derived from C and C++ but was based on a higher level of understanding.</p>
